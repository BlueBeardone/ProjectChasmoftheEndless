# Project-Chasm-of-the-Endless
Chasm of the Endless is a punishing action-roguelike. Plunge into an ever-changing dungeon beneath a magical catastrophe. Master real-time combat, adapt to each brutal run, and see how deep you can go before you fall. Death is permanent, but the urge to descend is endless.
